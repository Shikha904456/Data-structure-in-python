For example, you can write a function that takes a Shape object as an argument and calculates its area. This function can be used with any subclass of Shape, such as Square, Circle, or Triangle, without modification.\n","- **Enhancing maintainability:** Polymorphism makes code more maintainable by allowing you to change the implementation of a subclass without affecting the code that uses it. For example, if you need to change the way that the area of a Square is calculated, you can simply modify the area() method in the Square class. This change will not affect any of the code that uses the Square class."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"g8VRy8pJVvFd"},"source":["#46.Describe how Python supports polymorphism with duck typing"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"cEBDMJk-W2_g"},"source":["Duck Typing in Python:\n","Behavior-Based: Python focuses on an object's behavior (methods and attributes it supports) rather than its type or class hierarchy.\n","\n","No Explicit Interface: Objects are accepted based on their ability to respond to method calls and attribute accesses.\n","\n","Example: Different objects can be used interchangeably if they implement similar methods, without needing a common base class or interface."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vyVcP_M6W9v9"},"source":["#47.How do you achieve encapsulation in Python"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"y5gfIuuUXXFQ"},"source":["Encapsulation in Python:\n","Classes and Objects: Use classes to encapsulate data (attributes) and methods.\n","\n","Access Modifiers: Use naming conventions (_ for protected, __ for private) to indicate attribute visibility.\n","\n","Getter and Setter Methods: Optionally define methods to access and modify private attributes for controlled access.\n","\n","Benefits:\n","Modularity: Bundles data and methods into coherent units (classes), enhancing code organization.\n","\n","Information Hiding: Controls access to data to protect implementation details and ensure data integrity.\n","\n","Flexibility: Python's dynamic nature allows for flexible implementation of encapsulation principles without strict enforcement."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zwG_Rwr2XmG5"},"source":["#48.Can encapsulation be bypassed in Python?
